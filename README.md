# MyClone

Java Project with output to console.

My first Java project ever, after avoiding Java until the 20th anniversary of the language.

Creates a virtual world that takes a users name, introduces the application,
and then has the user make choices to output a favorite sentence, build a random sentence,
and finally participate in a beer chant war.


Developed using NetBeans 8.0.2 and standard JDK 1.8

VirtualWorldTestClass is the unit testing class.

TestApp is the integrated testing class or main execution file to run as a user.
